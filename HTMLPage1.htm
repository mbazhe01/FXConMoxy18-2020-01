				<P class="Head"><FONT class="Head" size="5"><FONT size="3">Tweedy, Browne was founded by 
							Forrest Berwind Tweedy in 1920 as Tweedy &amp; Co., a dealer in closely held 
							and inactively traded securities. The firm's 85-year history is grounded in 
							undervalued securities, first as a market maker, then as an investor and 
							investment advisor. Our investment approach derives from the work of the late 
							Benjamin Graham who co-authored the first textbook on investment research, 
							Security Analysis (1934) and authored The Intelligent Investor (1949). Graham, 
							through his investment firm Graham-Newman Corp., was one of Tweedy's primary 
							brokerage clients in the 1930's, 1940's and 1950's. It was through Graham that 
							the original partners of Tweedy developed brokerage relationships with 
							investment legends such as Walter Schloss and Warren Buffett, and met Tom Knapp 
							who was to come to the firm in 1957 from Graham-Newman and lead its conversion 
							from broker to investor.</FONT></FONT></P>

						<P class="Head"><FONT class="Head" size="3">In 1959 the partners of then Tweedy, Browne 
								&amp; Knapp pooled their capital in a partnership investment vehicle called TBK 
								Partners. In 1968, the firm accepted its first outside money management clients 
								as limited partners of TBK. In 1975, Tweedy, Browne registered as an investment 
								advisor and began managing separate accounts for individuals and institutions. 
								As of March 31, 2006, the firm managed in excess of $13.0 billion for 
								individuals, institutions, partnerships, off-shore funds and two mutual funds 
								of a registered investment company, the Tweedy, Browne Global Value Fund and 
								the Tweedy, Browne American Value Fund. A more complete account of the firm's 
								colorful history is contained in the March 31, 1995 Annual Report to 
								shareholders beginning on page 7. We think you will enjoy reading it.</FONT></P>

				<P class="Head"><FONT class="Head" size="3">We do not attempt to be all things to all 
						people, but instead pursue a value-oriented approach to investment management 
						first pioneered by Benjamin Graham. We invest in undervalued common stocks in 
						the United States and outside the United States. Tweedy, Browne first began 
						investing outside the U.S. in 1983 by applying the same principles of value 
						investing that we had successfully applied for the management of U.S. 
						securities. The Managing Directors of Tweedy, Browne have always invested right 
						alongside its clients. As of March 31, 2006, the current and retired principals 
						of Tweedy, Browne and their families and Tweedy, Browne employees had more than 
						$587.4 million of their personal funds invested in portfolios combined with or 
						similar to their clients' portfolios including approximately $83.7 million in 
						the Global Value Fund and $42.6 million in the American Value Fund. We have 
						always owned what our clients own.<BR>
